# In this we have leaned about the string operayion such as string slicing and string len

name = "Amit Pandey"
# Here we are doing the slicing
print(name[0:4])
print(name[:4])
print(len(name))

# Here we are doing the negative slicing and python do like print(name[len(name)-2:len(name)-5])
print(name[-4:-1])
