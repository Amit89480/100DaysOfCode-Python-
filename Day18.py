# In this we have learned about while loops and do while loops

# n = int(input("Enter the Number: "))
#
# while n>=0:
#     print(n)
#     n=n-1




# Here we have written this program to enumeretate do-while loop

# n=int(input("number "))
# print(n);
# while(n<=1):
#     n=int(input("Enter the number to enumerate do-while loop"))
#     print(n);
