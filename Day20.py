# In this we will be learning about the functions and seeing different things about function




# Function for summing up to numbers

# def sum(a, b):
#     return a + b
# 
# 
# print(sum(23, 78))


# suppose a programmer wants to write a programmer later so he can write pass keyword so that python interpreter 
# doesnt generate error 
# def fibonacci(a): pass 


# program for fibonacci series


# def fibo(n):
#     num1=0
#     num2=1
#     for i in range(n):
#         ans=num1+num2
#         num1=num2
#         num2=ans
#     return ans
#
#
# print(fibo(12), end =" ")
