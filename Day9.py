# In this we have learned about various type conversion one is implict and another one is explict


# Implict example

a = 9.8;
b = 8;
print(a + b);

# this will print 17.8 as it convert the data type into higher order


# EXplict daya type

a = 8
b = "9"
print(a + int(b))

# it will print 17 as we have used int method as there are many more which we have converted string to int
