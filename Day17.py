# In this we have learned about the for Loop

# list = ["Amit","Ashis","Misti"]
# for i in list:
#     print(i)
#     for j in i:
#         print(j)


# here we have learned about the range function
# for i in range(1,5):
#     print(i)


# here tha last argument depicts the increment and decrement

# for i in range(1,10,3):
#     print(i)
